1) capture mp4 of website with Giphy Capture app (save as 320px and standard)
  - or use Quicktime and choose "New Screen Recording" (seems buggy)
2) upload video file to cloudinary and convert to gif
    - reduce file quality (80%?)
    - view full size link and add "e_loop/" after "video/upload/"
      so that gif loops

- image size should be approximately: 360 x 190 for the thumbnails
- HTML 5 also has a video tag that can play mp4 files but I found that
  it would flicker when looping.
